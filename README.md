## Halo MongoDB Database

This project models the back-end database of **Halo**, Grand Canyon Universityâ€™s Canvas-like homework submission system.  
It was built to demonstrate **NoSQL design, JSON data modeling, and MongoDB aggregation pipelines**.

The system captures entities such as **Students, Professors, Courses, Departments, and Assignments**,  
with nested documents and array references to model relationships.
